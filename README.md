Requires a 2-button joystick, or the keyboard

Features:

- arcade perfect gameplay
- 25 fps super smooth on vanilla A1200, 50 fps with fastmem

Note:

AGA version runs on vanilla A1200: arcade exact colors
OCS version runs on any OCS amiga with 512k expansion: slightly less colors (not
really noticeable) and not very fast either

Instructions:

5: insert coin
1/2: start game
arrows/joystick: move

Bugs:

- sometimes game can kind of lock up (ex: level 11). Very rare.
  If that occurs, just wait a few seconds, monsters commit suicide,
  and game gets to next level.
