- release mode is completely buggy
- sfx: assign channels & priorities to sounds. Use channel 3 mostly
  use channel 2 only for special items: waiting to see if music can hold on 2 channels,
  else would have to use audiomixer
- replicate most bobs as sprites (not 2x wide)
- ECS version
- highscore save

- set flag when tunes are played. Clear flags immediately
  for other sfx (hoping it works, else we'll need a "end of sample" callback
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq
- optimize 0x20 write = clear
- report 2 last optimization phases in 6809 converter
- implement trainer invincible.infinite lives
- title screen hardcode the title rising clipping

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
