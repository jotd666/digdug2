possible pb de tri 


- 8F23 read 251D 80 vs 00 (amiga) => changes sequ and 117x values
- 8F37 read 04 vs 00 (amiga) also changes seq
 then 8F39: 8E 11 77       LDX    #$1177
8F3C: E6 86          LDB    A,X
8F3E: 6F 86          CLR    A,X
8F40: 86 20          LDA    #$20
all is shifted: character positions are mixed up

- player dies after ground destruction: repositioned in water
- when dstroying ground, main character position changed!
  let game lock up, memwatch on player pos
- instrumented: positions & movement completely corrupt: also happens in non-instrumented
- left disappearing sprites appear on the right: debug / mockup
- still shifted task trashing leads to address errors
- set flag when tunes are played. Clear flags immediately
  for other sfx (hoping it works, else we'll need a "end of sample" callback

- credit: not showing anymore
- set_status_bitplanes 33 v 32 "cheat": map "CREDIT" higher
  basically let right part of the bottom status bitplanes swap rows
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq
- demo attract mode not working properly
- optimize 0x20 write = clear
- parasite tiles on top right
- bottom of the screen not showing (credit, round): check set_status_bitplanes
- report 2 last optimization phases in 6809 converter
- implement trainer invincible.infinite lives
- title screen hardcode the title rising clipping

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
