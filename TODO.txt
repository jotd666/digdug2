- ECS version: only 16 colors, no dual playfield, update_bg_tile also writes in back buffer
  => update_bg_tile: write also to back restore buffer, if double buffering, do update twice too
     or just in both buffers
 - sfx: assign channels & priorities to sounds. Use channel 3 mostly
  use channel 2 only for special items: waiting to see if music can hold on 2 channels,
  else would have to use audiomixer
- set flag when tunes are played. Clear flags immediately
  for other sfx (hoping it works, else we'll need a "end of sample" callback
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq
- report 2 last optimization phases in 6809 converter
- implement trainer invincible.infinite lives
- command line arguments
- startup shell

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
