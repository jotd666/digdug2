- sign extension missing: clear_some_params_8732 CLR A,X
  OK for LDA A,X !!
- enemy layout depends on the level: debug using that maybe (tables)
; copy positions into $1707
C4D9: 30 07          LEAX   $7,X
C4DB: 86 18          LDA    #$18
- enemy positions corrupt at some point???
- level 6 interrupt corrupts stack?? relocate
- 10D2: set to 0 (cheat key toggle enemies) to debug better
- pump moves diagonally after a while
- sometimes sprite positions are completely off: one enemy has the sprite
  of the main character
- find why game locks up
- set flag when intro tune is played (4040)
- credit: not showing anymore
- set_status_bitplanes 33 v 32 "cheat": map "CREDIT" higher
  basically let right part of the bottom status bitplanes swap rows
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq
- demo attract mode not working properly
- optimize 0x20 write = clear
- parasite tiles on top right
- bottom of the screen not showing (credit, round): check set_status_bitplanes
- implement sprite double height: test in start game screen
- report 2 last optimization phases in 6809 converter
- implement trainer invincible.infinite lives
- start screen: bottom right dragon flipped not mirrored (mockup ok)
- title screen hardcode the title rising clipping

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}
