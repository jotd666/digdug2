- missing sounds for pick bonus (mushroom...)
- missing sounds for earth crumbling
- command line arguments
- sometimes lockup at level 11 for instance, then monsters suicide
- sfx: assign channels & priorities to sounds. Use channel 3 mostly
  use channel 2 only for special items: waiting to see if music can hold on 2 channels,
  else would have to use audiomixer
- killed sound: make a module maybe
- set flag when tunes are played. Clear flags immediately
  for other sfx (hoping it works, else we'll need a "end of sample" callback
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq


minor/optims:

- can still insert coin with fire on "get ready" screen
- slow & flickering from floppy 68000
- pump appears on top status screen at times


fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
