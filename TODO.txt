- hw sprites: garbled graphics at start
- hw sprites: we don't have more than 1 copy of the sprite in memory, so if it's assigned at some point
  memorize it in a table or in a list so if it appears again we can't assign that one
  (mirrors could be allowed)
  hw_sprites: mirror shit
  hw sprites: case of 32 bit height
- sfx: assign channels & priorities to sounds. Use channel 3 mostly
  use channel 2 only for special items: waiting to see if music can hold on 2 channels,
  else would have to use audiomixer
- replicate most bobs as sprites (not 2x wide)
- ECS version
- highscore save

- set flag when tunes are played. Clear flags immediately
  for other sfx (hoping it works, else we'll need a "end of sample" callback
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq
- report 2 last optimization phases in 6809 converter
- implement trainer invincible.infinite lives
- title screen forget about tiles except the left top one, and display from one
  big bob instead to save blitting, thus we can implement clipping that way by
  blitting with variable height!

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
