minor/optims:

- cycle exact sprites flicker maybe bad wait to set sprite pos (depends on fmode?)
- pump appears on top status screen at times
- sometimes lockup at level 11 for instance, then monsters suicide
  maybe fixed now with better 60Hz makeup interrupt as never occurs anymore now
- D5 should be saved (or not changed) on osd calls outside interrupts

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
