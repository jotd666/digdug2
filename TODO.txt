- re-optimize
- pass optimizer
- cycle exact sprites flicker maybe bad wait to set sprite pos (depends on fmode?)
- command line arguments
- sfx: assign channels & priorities to sounds. Use channel 3 mostly
  use channel 2 only for special items, don't use auto, use priorities
- first level: start music plays completely, other levels: it doesn't
- killed: 2 consecutive sounds, first sound doesn't play
  probably because music stops after, then second sound plays
  but then stuck because game waits:
  should put that in a module: 2 different tracks
  

minor/optims:

- can still insert coin with fire on "get ready" screen
- slow & flickering from floppy 68000
- pump appears on top status screen at times
- sometimes lockup at level 11 for instance, then monsters suicide
  maybe fixed now with better 60Hz makeup interrupt


fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
