- re-optimize manually
- pass optimizer
- command line arguments
- highscore tune: playing but screen doesn't wait for ack
- first level: start music cut by main music: test again

minor/optims:

- cycle exact sprites flicker maybe bad wait to set sprite pos (depends on fmode?)
- slow & flickering from floppy 68000
- pump appears on top status screen at times
- sometimes lockup at level 11 for instance, then monsters suicide
  maybe fixed now with better 60Hz makeup interrupt as never occurs anymore now


fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
