- sfx: assign channels & priorities to sounds. Use channel 3 mostly
  use channel 2 only for special items: waiting to see if music can hold on 2 channels,
  else would have to use audiomixer
- mega crash at times when stack is clobbered: PC=$2366bc60 => HALT1
- bottom of the screen not showing (credit, round): check set_status_bitplanes
- credit: not showing anymore
- set_status_bitplanes 33 v 32 "cheat": map "CREDIT" higher
  basically let right part of the bottom status bitplanes swap rows
- replicate most bobs as sprites (not 2x wide)
- highscore save

- set flag when tunes are played. Clear flags immediately
  for other sfx (hoping it works, else we'll need a "end of sample" callback
- when music is avail, change the clear 4040 in irq
- optimize 0x20 write = clear
- report 2 last optimization phases in 6809 converter
- implement trainer invincible.infinite lives
- title screen hardcode the title rising clipping

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
